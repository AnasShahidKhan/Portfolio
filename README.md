# 🚀 Anas Shahid - Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built from scratch and deployed on GitHub Pages with a custom domain.

## ✨ Features

This portfolio was custom-built to showcase my skills and projects. It is not based on a template and features several advanced UI elements:

* **Fully Responsive Design:** Adapts cleanly from large desktop monitors down to all mobile screen sizes.
* **Modern Glassmorphism Theme:** A custom "frosted glass" bubble effect is used across all interactive cards and sections.
* **Animated "Aurora" Background:** Subtle, floating gradient orbs move across the background for a high-tech, premium feel.
* **"Cyber Radar" Hero:** The main introduction box features an animated CSS-only radar sweep, complete with flashing "blips" that sync to the beam's rotation.
* **Interactive Nav Menu:**
    * **Desktop:** A "lavalamp" style bubble slides and resizes to follow the user's mouse.
    * **Mobile:** A custom, slide-out hamburger menu with full navigation.
* **Advanced Hover Effects:**
    * **About Me:** The main bio card magnifies to 130% on hover.
    * **Core Technologies:** An interactive "magnifying" effect where the hovered skill bubble grows while others shrink.
    * **Experience:** A "reveal on hover" glass bubble for timeline items.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
